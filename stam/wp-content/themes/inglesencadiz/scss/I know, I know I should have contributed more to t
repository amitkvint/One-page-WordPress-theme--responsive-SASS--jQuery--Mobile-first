I know, I know I should have contributed more to the WordPress library...but I have good excuses - I am busy working, I have 3 kids and I need to be practical and have a real world approach to earning money.

I am developing for the web since 1999 (before that I was a team manager in the biggest internet provider in Israel), I am very strong with HTML5, SASS & CSS, & I am strong enough with jQuery, Javascript & WordPress related PHP.

I work for the last 8 years as a freelancer as well as for web agencies (http://www.linnovate.net/ | https://codeable.io/ | https://www.tweaky.com), and though with the last two work is a bit...well...boring it did give me a lot of WordPress hours which I use for my more advanced projects.

My favourite kind of work is taking a design and making a custom WordPress theme like here - gilataviv.co.il or here inglesencadiz.com. I also teach, for years now, Front End development, lately in 5 months long courses of the local Spanish government (Junta De Andalucia).

I am very creative and very good with people & customers(I don't think i have ever let down one neither :))

That's it I guess, 
Cheers, 
Amit
